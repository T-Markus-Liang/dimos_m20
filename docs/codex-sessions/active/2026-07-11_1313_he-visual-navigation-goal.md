# HE Visual Navigation Goal

## Metadata

- Date: 2026-07-11 13:13 CST
- Session id: current Codex goal thread
- Project: dimos-wd-m20
- Workspace: VM `/home/markus/work/dimos_wd_m20`; Orin `/home/ubuntu/he/dimos_wd_m20`
- Task: research, benchmark, select and integrate a visual SLAM navigation foundation for HE
- Status: active - sensor admission tooling and candidate matrix implementation in progress
- Branch if relevant: `codex/he-orin` from `e495dadb`

## User Request Summary

Build a vision-only HE navigation foundation using Aurora RGB/depth/IR/point
cloud and IMU. Audit DimOS branches and current external SOTA candidates,
benchmark them against HE and Orin constraints, select one main solution, and
integrate a safe `he-visual-slam-shadow` stack with pose, map, TF and localization
health while keeping real motion disconnected.

## Work Done

- Read the complete goal objective and canonical HE deployment/sensor context.
- Confirmed VM and Orin are clean at `e495dadb` and the sensor service is active
  with zero restarts.
- Established a seven-step execution plan from baseline evidence through
  internal/external candidate audit, HE benchmark tooling, ADR, shadow
  integration and completion audit.
- Re-ran the full Orin static closeout in a clean ROS 2 Humble shell. Deployment
  integrity, 10 unit tests, isolated control dry-run, live sensors and both
  read-only gates passed. Motion remained disabled.
- Recorded current Orin evidence: `he-dimos-sense` 1006-1009MiB, zero restarts,
  about 3.5GiB available memory, 579MiB zram use, GPU about 11%, temperature
  about 59C and depth validity 20.4% in the latest check.
- Audited isolated DimOS refs for ORB-SLAM3, RTAB-Map, SLAM evaluation, PGO,
  relocalization, semantic mapping, visual-navigation sketches and learned
  depth. The existing ORB wrapper has an incomplete input contract and known
  transform defect; the existing RTAB module is an external-odometry map
  backend rather than a complete Aurora visual frontend.
- Gathered official repository, maintenance, license, platform and benchmark
  scope evidence for Isaac ROS Visual SLAM, RTAB-Map, ORB-SLAM3, OpenVINS,
  VINS-Fusion, DPVO, DROID-SLAM, MASt3R-SLAM and DINOv3.
- Drafted a unified candidate evaluation ledger plus ROS-independent depth and
  timestamp helpers, tests, an Aurora diagnostic CLI and bounded rosbag recorder.
- Committed and pushed the first qualification workflow as `6418c0fe`; Orin
  fast-forwarded to it and all 13 HE tests passed there.
- The first live diagnostic measured about 20.6% global and 15.8% center depth
  validity with especially sparse lower image tiles. Its initial IMU offset was
  invalid because the faster IMU series stopped collecting before the RGB
  window ended; fixed the tool to retain the full overlapping window and ignore
  unmatched timestamp edges before drawing a hardware conclusion.
- Corrected live evidence measured IMU-to-RGB nearest offset at 5.81ms median
  and 10.29ms P95. Camera streams have occasional one-frame gaps; RGB-depth P95
  was 68.35ms. Driver state is align/depth-correction enabled but RGB-D capture
  disabled, so an isolated RGB-D mode A/B test is required.
- Recorded a motion-disabled static rosbag at
  `/home/ubuntu/he/data/visual-navigation/20260711_133901_static-qualification`:
  3.541s, 280MiB, 669 messages, 52 samples for each Aurora stream and 171 IMU
  samples. Control topics had zero messages and safety gates passed before and
  after capture.
- Found and fixed a recorder integrity bug where `SHA256SUMS` included itself.
  Regenerated the existing list; bag, manifest and metadata all verify.
- Completed an isolated Aurora `rgbd_enable` A/B. It did not improve camera
  pairing or depth coverage and reduced point-cloud rate to 12.2Hz with worse
  timestamp gaps. Restored the unchanged systemd default (`false`) and passed
  live sensor/read-only gates.
- Verified Isaac ROS compatibility boundaries from official release trees and
  apt repositories: RGB-D starts in 4.4 on Noble/Jazzy; Jammy/Humble 3.2 lacks
  RGB-D. Confirmed official RTAB-Map 0.23.7 Humble arm64 packages are available
  on Orin without installing them yet.
- Installed only RTAB-Map 0.23.7 odometry/SLAM runtime packages on Orin. Direct
  ROS repository downloads repeatedly stalled, so official apt URIs were
  downloaded through the Tsinghua ROS mirror, checked against apt-provided MD5,
  copied to the apt cache and installed locally. Disk increase was 66,953,216
  bytes; no GUI/demo/meta package was installed.
- Live RGB-D odometry produced pose at about 8-10Hz. Bounding approximate sync
  to 20ms removed bad-pair warnings, reduced processing to about 63-76ms and
  used about 190-197MiB RSS with roughly 30-36% of one CPU core.
- Found that `ros2 run` can leave the RTAB-Map child alive after signaling the
  wrapper. Cleaned the process and switched experiments to the native binary
  under `timeout`; no persistent SLAM service exists yet.
- Added a version-controlled RTAB-Map parameter YAML and native-PID shadow
  runner. It constrains RGB/depth pairing to 20ms, mapping detection to 2Hz,
  disables TF publication and refuses to run if navigation publishers exist.
- First mapping run produced occupancy, MapData, SLAM Info and a 4.3MiB
  database, but disabling TF caused repeated missing `he_visual_odom ->
  base_link` warnings. Enable the isolated HE-prefixed map/odom TF chain for
  the next run; it does not collide with the current platform tree.

## Decisions

- Preserve `HEConnection.enabled=False` and zero `/he/nav_cmd_vel` publishers
  throughout research, benchmark and shadow integration.
- Treat public leaderboard scores as supporting evidence only; HE data and Orin
  runtime evidence decide the final selection.
- Keep full-rate local algorithm inputs separate from bounded latest-only Rerun.
- Pilot RTAB-Map 0.23.7 RGB-D first because an official Humble/Jammy arm64
  package exists. Defer Isaac ROS RGB-D: it starts in release 4.4 on
  Noble/Jazzy, while HE-compatible release 3.2 lacks that mode. This is still a
  test order, not final selection; HE/Orin evidence and the ADR gate remain.
- Exclude DROID-SLAM from Orin deployment because its current official README
  requires at least 11GB GPU memory for inference.

## Current State

- Static safety and sensor service baseline are re-verified.
- Candidate matrix and visual data tools are committed and synchronized; the
  corrected live timing rerun is in progress. No visual SLAM package has been
  installed or selected yet.
- Aurora depth coverage and spatial-temporal qualification remain open gates.
- The first static raw dataset and diagnostic evidence are preserved; moving
  trajectory data remains gated on a new vehicle-down confirmation.

## Resume Instructions

1. Read this log and the active plan.
2. Validate and commit the staged visual data tools and candidate ledger.
3. Run the diagnostic and bounded static recorder on Orin, preserving JSON and
   dataset manifest evidence.
4. Do not enable motion or restore LD19.

## Open Questions

- Can Aurora depth coverage and synchronization meet RGB-D/VIO prerequisites?
- Can RTAB-Map RGB-D produce stable stationary pose/map output despite the
  current sparse and spatially uneven Aurora depth?
